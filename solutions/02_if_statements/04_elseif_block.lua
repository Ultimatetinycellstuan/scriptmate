-- let's start by declaring a variable
-- this isn't necessary, but is an acceptable solution
x = 10

-- if x is 5, print "x is 5"
-- if x is NOT 5, but is 10, print "x is 10"
-- if x is something ELSE, print "x is neither 5 or 10"

if x == 5 then
    print("x is 5")
elseif x == 10 then
    print("x is 10")
else
    print("x is neither 5 or 10")
end
